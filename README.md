# ðŸš¦ Road Accident Risk Prediction

## Overview
Road Accident Risk Prediction is a machine learning-based web application designed to estimate the risk level of road accidents based on environmental and situational features. The application is built using Streamlit for the user interface and Scikit-Learn for the backend ML model.

## Features
- Predicts accident risk based on temperature, visibility, and weather conditions.
- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit.
- Utilizes a trained ML model for accurate, real-time predictions.
- Modular and easy to extend with additional features.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Scikit-Learn**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Muhammed-AlReay/Road-Accident-Prediction.git
   cd Road-Accident-Prediction
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Launch the app in your browser using the command above.
2. Enter the required inputs: temperature, visibility, and weather condition.
3. Click the **Predict Accident Risk** button to see the predicted risk level.

## Dataset
The dataset used includes features like weather conditions, temperature, visibility, and other contextual variables to train the model on real-world accident patterns.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate more environmental and traffic-related features.
- Improve model performance with time-series or ensemble methods.
- Deploy on a cloud platform for public access.
